Thank you for your interest in Yoimiya (the “Bot”, “Game” and "Service"), developed by [ookamiiixd](https://github.com/ookamiiixd) (Royhan) and contributors ("we", "us", “our”). To keep the game functional and provide the best possible experience, we collect some necessary data from Discord users (the "User", "you", "they", "their") who have interacted with the game, as well as the respective Discord guilds (the "Server(s)") that Yoimiya has been added to.

This Privacy Policy was designed to publicly outline our policies regarding the data we collect via our bot or any other software we have developed (collectively, our "Service(s)").

### Data We Collect

To deliver the best experience to both Discord and our players, we collect the following data:

- **User ID**: The unique identifier that belongs to your Discord account. This allows us to assign game and verification data to a particular Discord user account. User IDs are accessible by any Discord user.

We do not sell or otherwise share any collected data with any third parties.
